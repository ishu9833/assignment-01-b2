# Coder never stop codding till death!

Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.

 First learn computer science and all the theory. Next develop a programming style. Then forget all that and just hack.

 Most good programmers do programming not because they expect to get paid or get adulation by the public, but it is fun to program.
